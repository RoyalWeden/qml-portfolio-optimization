### Description

The purpose of this project is to predict the change of a certain stock with Variational Quantum Regression ~~optimize a portfolio with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm~~ using the IBM Qiskit Python Library.

The dataset for this project at its current state was found on Kaggle for [S&P 500 stock data](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/sandp500).

This project was for the QuBes 2-week camp. Although it is not complete, I will continue to learn such topics and create a finished project in the future.
